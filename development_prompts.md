# Math Quiz Adventure - Development Prompts Log

This file contains all the prompts used during the development of Math Quiz Adventure, organized chronologically for reference and checking purposes.

---

## Initial Game Creation

### Prompt 1: Basic Game Concept
```
Create a simple 2D platformer game in Pygame called "Math Quiz Adventure" for kids. The player controls a character that moves left and right and jumps across platforms. Place doors or gates throughout the level. When the player reaches a door, pause the game and display a basic math question (addition, subtraction, or multiplication). The player must select the correct answer from multiple choices to open the door and continue. If the answer is wrong, let them try again. Use colorful graphics and large, easy-to-read text. Make the questions get slightly harder as the player progresses. Add sound effects for correct and incorrect answers. Keep the controls simple: arrow keys to move and jump, and mouse or number keys to select answers.
```

**Output**: Created `math_quiz_adventure.py` with basic platformer mechanics, math questions, and simple graphics.

## Testing and Bug Fixes

### Prompt 2: Game Testing
```
run the math_quiz adventure file and try the game
```

**Output**: Successfully ran the game after setting up virtual environment and installing pygame.

### Prompt 3: UI Improvements
```
the resolution for the question pane is not right. fix it and make it more readable
```

**Output**: Enhanced question pane with:
- Larger box dimensions (700x500 → 650x520)
- Better font sizes (question: 52pt, answers: 32pt)
- Improved spacing and layout
- Shadow effects and better color coding
- Fixed overlapping text issues

## Feature Enhancements

### Prompt 4: Major Feature Addition
```
To make things interesting, add points for the player where they will gain points on the right answer. Also create a leaderboard to capture points for leading players. Add levels for the game for users - the difficulty of the questions should go up after every level. Consider 5 questions per level.
```

**Output**: Created `math_quiz_adventure_enhanced.py` with:
- Points system (10 points per correct answer)
- Bonus streaks (double points for 3+ consecutive correct)
- 5-level progression system
- Persistent JSON leaderboard
- Level completion bonuses (50 points)
- Enhanced UI with score tracking

### Prompt 5: UI Refinement
```
the answers are very big in font and the message to choose an answer is coming as an overlap to question 3
```

**Output**: Fixed font sizing and layout issues:
- Reduced answer font from 42pt to 32pt
- Adjusted button spacing and positioning
- Eliminated text overlapping
- Better visual hierarchy

## Advanced Features

### Prompt 6: Level Progression Issues
```
There's an issue with the game where the user is taken to the next level even before they finish all 5 questions in that level
```

**Output**: Fixed level progression logic:
- Changed from question-based to door-based completion
- Only correct answers count toward progress
- UI shows "Doors: X/5" instead of "Questions: X/5"
- Proper level advancement criteria

### Prompt 7: Display Bug Fix
```
After finishing first level, the pop up message says that Level 2 is complete. This needs to be fixed
```

**Output**: Corrected level completion message timing:
- Shows correct completed level number
- Proper sequence: Complete → Show Message → Advance → Transition
- Clear next level indication

### Prompt 8: Comprehensive Game Enhancement
```
Can you tell users that they have moved to the next round. Also, change the maze at each level. Go upto 5 levels. At the start, ask the name of the player so that you can capture it on leaderboard
```

**Output**: Major enhancements including:
- Player name input at game start
- 5 unique maze layouts per level
- Level transition screens with announcements
- Personalized progress tracking
- Enhanced game flow and state management
